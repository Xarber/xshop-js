# X-Shop JS
*Notice: This package is still in alpha stage. Currently, only basic Tinfoil downloads are supported, and there is no ETA for the project.*
This is the NodeJS version of the PHP X-Shop package. This package allows you to upload your game backups onto your servers to download them from anywhere else!
**You still need to configure port-forwarding and possibly a custom domain paired with static IP address.**
## ONLY USE YOUR OWN GAME BACKUPS, AND FOR PERSONAL USE!!
