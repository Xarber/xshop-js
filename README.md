# X-Shop JS
*Notice: This package hasn't been heavily tested yet. Currently, it's not a development priority, but all features from the legacy xshop should be available.*
This is the NodeJS version of the PHP X-Shop package. This package allows you to upload your game backups onto your servers to download them from anywhere else!
**You still need to configure port-forwarding and possibly a custom domain paired with static IP address.**
## ONLY USE YOUR OWN GAME BACKUPS, AND FOR PERSONAL USE!!
